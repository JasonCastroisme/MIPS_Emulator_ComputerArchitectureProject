# MIPS_Emulator_ComputerArchitectureProject
 
A MIPS emulator coded through C++ that reads MIPS machine instructions from the provided binary executable files and correctly simulates their behavior. Some skeleton code provided by the professor.

Project instructions and description included as reference.

Project compiled and executed on school's linux server. Here are the following commands to run simulation.

compile : $ make

simulate mips file: ./simulator sssp.mips

replace 'sssp.mips' with any mips file to check output.

.out files are attached to ensure correct output.
